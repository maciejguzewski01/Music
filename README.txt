This project is a simple Android music player, targeted for API 34.
It allows users to control music playback with basic actions (play/pause, next, previous, seek bar),
create playlists and play music in three modes - ordered, randomized and from playlist order.
Additionally it allows to search for currently playing song in youtube service with one button.
The app displays notifications with the currently played song and action buttons.
It is worth to note that if folder set as music source contains large amount of files it can crush the app.
